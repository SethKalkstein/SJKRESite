			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>
				Like most Realtors, this is my second career. My first career was as a manager, buyer, and consultant in gourmet grocery. As for real estate, my family has been in the housing business for hundreds of years. Kalkstein literally translates lime stone! Back in the 1600’s we were named for a main building material of the time. Had I not entered the real estate trade, I would be the first in my line of the Kalkstein family to opt out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I decided to enter the trade as a Realtor due to my extensive background in negotiating, sales, customer service, data analysis, pricing, and buying. I’ve always worked on and built strong teams, so I joined the Neil Kugelman Team at Elfant Wissahickon Realtors, the largest independent brokerage in Philadelphia. I can think of no better partnership than Neil’s 30+ years of real estate experience and 1000’s of transactions, my decades of business expertise, and Elfant’s long respected reputation in Philadelphia as the company with big business resources and a friendly small town "mom and pop" feel.

			<p>
				I’ve owned my house in Passyunk Square for over a decade. I’ve never lived more than a half mile outside of Philadelphia, with the exception of a few months in Colorado. I love watching the Philadelphia neighborhoods evolve over time. I work with clients in every section of the city and the suburbs. Particular areas of interest for me are South Philadelphia, Fishtown/Northern Liberties area, University City, and the North West Section of the city.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time I still harnesses my love of food by cooking every day. I also write computer code professionally. When I’m not in my house snuggling and playing with the cats, I love walking, biking and hiking our great city.
